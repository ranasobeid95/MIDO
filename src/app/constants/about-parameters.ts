            Ans: 'Normally no blood is present in the urine. Even though the presence of blood in the urine can be quite alarming, in many cases the cause is not so serious and has a quick remedy. Blood in the urine occurs when your kidneys, or other parts of your urinary tract allow blood cells to leak into the urine. This can be caused by many reasons: one of the most common is UTIs, but can also be caused by kidney infections, bladder or kidney stones, an enlarged prostate, even strenuous exercise that leads to trauma of the bladder, or dehydration that causes breakdown of RBCs.',

          {
            Q: 'what does SPG in urine mean?',
            Ans: 'Urine’s SPG values fall between 1.002 and 1.030. In general, higher values indicate lower hydration levels. If SPG doesn’t vary with fluid intake, this can indicate kidney disorders. Additionally very low levels of SPG can be caused by a rare metabolic disorder (diabetes insipidus) which causes excessive thirst and high amounts of diluted urine.',

Monitoring SPG of urine is a quick and non-invasive way to make sure you are getting all the fluids you need to perform your best. Additionally, SPG tracking is a quick and easy way to detect malfunctioning of your kidney, preventing serious health consequences down the line.',

            Ans: 'The pH is a measure of how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is. The range that we use to measure pH goes from 0-14, with 7 being neutral. If something has a pH lower than 7, then it is acidic, while something that has a pH higher than 7 is basic (alkaline). Having the right body pH is key for optimal functioning of many of the processes in your body.',

          {
            Q: 'what do urine pH values mean?',
            Ans: `Your urine’s pH is maintained by your kidneys ranging between 4.6 (acidic) to 8.5 (alkaline). The ideal urine pH is well balanced and ranges between 6.5-7.5. A more basic or neutral pH is achieved through consumption of plenty of fruits and vegetables. An acidic pH can indicate higher meat consumption. Some pathologies cause acidic pH too, these include: metabolic disorders, diarrhea, and kidney disease. A more basic pH can also signal some health disorders such as kidney dysfunction, vomiting or urinary tract infections (UTIs).`,
          },

            Q: `why tracking your urine's pH?`,
            Ans: `Many clinical studies have found that the pH is a good indicator of dietary intake of fruits, vegetables and meats. In general diets high in fish, meat or cheese decrease your urine’s pH, making it acidic. While diets high in fruits and vegetables can increase your urine’s pH, making it closer to balanced, or more basic. Changes in your diet that promote a balanced body pH (~7) come with many health benefits, including prevention of metabolic disorders, osteoporosis and kidney disorders, as well as bettering your cardiovascular health and increasing your energy levels!`,

          {
            Q: 'what is Glucose?',
            Ans: 'Glucose is a type of sugar that your body needs and uses as energy. The sugar comes into your body from the conversion of carbohydrates that you eat. After digestion the sugar enters your bloodstream, where normally it gets shuttle into cells with the help of insulin. Inside the cell it gets used as energy for all your body processes.',

          {
            Q: 'what does Glucose in urine mean?',
            Ans: `Normally your urine has no glucose (sugar), as the kidneys absorb the glucose from the liquids that pass through them, and send the glucose to the bloodstream. When glucose is present in the urine, this is because the kidneys are unable to take enough glucose from the urine, and it's called glycosuria. The cause of glycosuria (glucose in your urine) is excess sugars in your blood (hyperglycemia). This happens in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes.`,

            Ans: 'Ketones are chemicals that your body produces when it metabolizes fats. When not enough sugar is available for your cells to use as energy, your body switches energy currencies and goes from using glucose to fats, and then makes ketones.',

            Q: 'what do Ketones in urine mean?',
            Ans: 'Normally, none to very low levels of ketones are present in your urine. But metabolic disorders that either hamper production of insulin (type 1 diabetes), or make the body unresponsive to it (type 2 diabetes), make your  body incapable of using sugar as energy currency. As a response it uses fats, producing ketones, which then are present in your urine.',
